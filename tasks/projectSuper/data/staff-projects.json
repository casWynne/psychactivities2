          "description": "People who stutter (PWS) are experiencing everyday difficulties with not just communication, but also social relationships. Consequently, PWS are more prone to anxiety and social phobia, which in large parts is caused by social attitudes towards stuttering. General attitudes towards stuttering are well studied but much is unknown about specific population groups, mechanisms, accommodations, and effects on social relationships. Most research in this area uses existing questionnaires but there is also room for qualitative explorations. This topic can extend to other language or speech disorders, and even to healthy but atypical presentations, such as accents.",

This could be extended to other populations.",

This includes use of humour, celebrity endorsement, and carefully crafted colour schemes to generate a unique brand. Whilst all UK gambling providers now offer a suite of responsible gambling tools, the way that these tools are promoted is still bound up within the branding of each gambling provider. Gambling research draws on both qualitative and quantitative methods, with more work needed in this area to better understand how these factors impact on gambling behaviours.",
