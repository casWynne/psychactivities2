      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>
        From Academic Year 2627 onwards, Psychology students will choose modules across three levels:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 module in Year 1 (Level 4)</li>
        <li>2 modules in Year 2 (Level 5)</li>
        <li>3 modules in Year 3 (Level 6)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your selected modules will determine your graduation pathway. Choose a focused set for a specialist pathway, or
        mix broadly for a General Psychology award.
