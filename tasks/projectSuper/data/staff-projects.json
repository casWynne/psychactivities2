          "description": "People are able to extract and learn information about regularieis in their environment (statistical learning) which can occur without their awareness (implicit learning). We are interested in how this happens and what people learn, without realising. Research rocuses for the most part on how we learn connections or relationships between stimuli that are linked, predict certain outcomes or co-occur. This becomes more complicated when the relationships occur across time, or the learning is about distributed aspects like frequency or variability of stimuli and more research is needed to understand these aspects. Projects will look at measuring how and what people learn about distributional and conditional features of tehri environment, with a focus on stimuli seperated across time - examining timeing, serial order, frequency, variability, and conditional relationships between stimuli and how these impact learning.",

          "description": "People who stutter (PWS) are experiencing everyday difficulties with not just communication, but also social relationships. Consequently, PWS are more prone to anxiety and social phobia, which in large parts is caused by social attitudes towards stuttering. General attitudes towards stuttering are well studied but much is unknown about specific population groups, mechanisms, accommodations, and effects on social relationships. Most research in this area uses existing questionnaires but there is also room for qualitative explorations. This topic can extend to other language or speech disorders, and even to healthy but atypical presentations, such as accents.",

This includes use of humour, celebrity endorsement, and carefully crafted colour schemes to generate a unique brand. Whilst all UK gambling providers now offer a suite of responsible gambling tools, the way that these tools are promoted is still bound up within the branding of each gambling provider.
